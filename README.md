For the Giant Joystick use the Branch `GiantJoystick` : https://github.com/playAbilityTech/Motion-Gamepad/tree/GiantJoystick

For the Balance board joystick use the Branch `BalanceBoard-Xinput` : https://github.com/playAbilityTech/Motion-Gamepad/tree/BalanceBoard-Xinput
## Features

The IMU-Joystick is assembled in less than 15 minutes and costs about ‚Ç¨5.
When connected to a computer, the board presents itself as a USB joystick. Using the MPU6050, the Arduino measures acceleration & rotation data and maps it to joystick behaviour. The precise mapping of sensor data to joystick axes/buttons can be configured in the Arduino sketch. The controller is automatically detected as a generic joystick device on Linux, Mac, and Windows, without further software:

## How to build an IMU-Joystick

You can put together your own IMU-Joystick in about 1-2h. Except for mounting pin headers, no soldering is required.

### 1. Get the hardware
  - [Arduino(-compatible) Pro Micro](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Pro-Micro-for-arduino-ATmega32U4-5V-16MHz-Module-with-2-row-pin-header-For-Leonardo/32773740303.html), any ATmega32U4-based Arduino will do.
  - [MPU6050](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/versandkostenfrei-gy-521-mpu-6050-mpu6050-modul-3-achse-analog-Gyro-Sensoren-beschleunigungsmesser-modul/32315092057.html) (GY-521 breakout), a low-cost accelerometer + gyroscope.
  - mini-sized [breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Breadboard-Protoboard-DIY-Kit-Universal-Transparent-Solderless-SYB-170-Breadboard-170Tie-points-Prototype-Boards-35X47MM/32717999019.html)
  - (optional) [push buttons](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/100pcs-6-6-5mm-4pin-Quality-Mini-Micro-Momentary-Tactile-Push-Button-Switch/32753141267.html)
  - some wire to make breadboard connections.


### 2. Assemble the hardware
Solder pin headers where needed; Place Pro Micro, GY-521 & wire on breadboard as follows:

</p>
Note that Pro Micro 8 & 9 do not need to connect to the MPU6050.

### 3. Get the software
- [Arduino IDE (>=1.6.6)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- external Arduino libraries:
  - [i2cdevlib](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib)
    collection (at least [I2Cdev](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/I2Cdev) and [MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050)).
    
    Follow the [installation instructions on the website](https://www.i2cdevlib.com/usage), or copy the folders `i2cdevlib/Arduino/I2Cdev` and `i2cdevlib/Arduino/MPU6050` from the project repository into your Arduino [libraries directory](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries) (`~/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux).
  - [ArduinoJoystickLibrary (>=2.0)](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)
  
    Copy the folder `ArduinoJoystickLibrary/Joystick` to your Arduino libraries directory.
- This repository. Copy any folder from `examples` into your Arduino directory.
    
### 4. Upload the software

Install the required libraries and upload the one of the example sketches to your Pro Micro board. Note that you might need to select Arduino Leonardo as a target board, when using the Arduino GUI.

## Usage
Plug the USB directly on the computer. (avoid USB Hub).

### On Windows 10
1. Go to  `Settings` -> `Devices`
2. `Devices and Printers` inside the `Printers and Scanners` tab
3. Right click on the controller -> `Game controller settings`

### Joystick to key Mapping
1. Download AntiMicro Software
https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases

2. Set the Axis 2 to UP | DOWN key
or see [this example profil](assets/joystick2updown.joystick.amgp)

## Build

pin 7 -> button 3 (onboard)

pin 15 -> button 4 (connector 1 green)
pin 14 -> button 5 (connector 1 blue)
pin 16 -> button 6 (connector 2 green)
pin 10 -> button 7 (connector 2 blue)

### Important
- Keep wire short Between MPU and Arduino (may cause issue if wire are to long)
- Avoid hub USB

### Arduino IDE

1. Install external Arduino libraries:
  - [i2cdevlib](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib) collection (at least [I2Cdev](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/I2Cdev) and [MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050)).

    Follow the [installation instructions on the website](https://www.i2cdevlib.com/usage), or copy the folders `i2cdevlib/Arduino/I2Cdev` and `i2cdevlib/Arduino/MPU6050` from the project repository into your Arduino [libraries directory](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries) (`~/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux).

  - [ArduinoJoystickLibrary (>=2.0)](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)

    Copy the folder `ArduinoJoystickLibrary/Joystick` to your Arduino libraries directory.

2. Upload the software (select Arduino Leonardo as a target board)
